I'm glad you got wiped shitter, you deserve it.", "I am a concerned mother with a 13 year old child and I am here to seek help regarding my son. Last week when we went to the supermarket, my son pointed to a white collumn and started jumping around screaming \u201cTOP LFG 3 PILLAR SUB 9!!!!!!\u201d As soon as he did that, the manager told us to leave. I told him that my son is just excited about something, and apologized. But the manager still told us to leave so he pulled up the white pillar that my son was going crazy over and threw it on the managers head. Then my son shouted \u201cNO DOWNCRUSH NICE PB. EVEN EGOM CAN DO BETTER YOU LITTLE **TER! ALL OF US TRUE FLEXING CHIMPS HATE YOU! \" What is a flexing chimp? Has my son begone transforming into a monkey? Can anyone explain what's going on? Later that day he drew big\" FC\" initials all over his room while repeating the same sentence over and over again : \"FC on top cheaters get banned.\" I also think he has been talking to an invisible new friend of his. And I think this friend could be Satan. Sometimes I can hear him talking about \"sir deadly and killing necron.\" PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HIM", "The exact moment I knew I was extremely horny is when I first started watching cchloe. I didn't know what it was about her that made me want her so badly, but every time she uploaded a video my dick became rock solid. I knew I wanted to do more than merely watch this block character. I wanted to fuck her tight little juicy asshole. For years, I dreamed of pounding her from behind and filling her with my cum and watching it drip out of her ass. However, no matter how many times I choked my chicken to the mere thought of him, my lust for this sexy succulent minecraft british egirl could not be satisfied. I tried everything, body pillows, dolls, even hiring a prostitute to dress up as her minecraft skin and suck my cock. Nothing was good enough. So, I made it my number one goal to create a hyper-realistic cchloe sex doll, so my fantasies could finally be brought to life. No longer will those who also have a unquenchable thirst for cchloe have to dream of releasing their sticky seed inside of her anal cavity, for they can now enjoy the real thing. But, creating this sex doll would not be an easy task, and this I knew. That's why I need your help to fund this Kickstarter. For donating $20, you get a T-shirt that says \"I'm horny for cchloe.\" For $40, you get the shirt and a coffee cup decorated with the finest cchloe rule 34. For $60, you get cchloe anal beads. For $100, you get a cchloe fleshlight that you can jizz in or whatever, plus all the other shit. Anything less than $20, and I'll just cum in a shoe box and mail it to your door, because fuck you I don't need your peasant change. I would like to make the world a better place with this cchloe sex doll, because I believe that everyone deserves the right to stick their dick in a british minecraft egirl.", "Duud there are 7/3 secrets in this room :astonished: and you're telling me that this is not secret duping :angry: Im gonna get fr*cking banned because im a party with someone who is secret duping :worried:  Someone- Someone in this party :anger: why  would you :confused:  why would you do that? :confused: Im streeeeming", "1. It seems like this entire argument revolves around hyperion being better because it has better clearing speeds. You realize that right click mages have been really good for clearing for a while now. Even a spirit sceptre is better than juju in clearing.\n\nHowever people don't buy it for clearing they buy it for DPS, where juju shortbow outclasses wither impact in if you have a good setup\n2. Terminator is the best for DPS but an arrow from a juju shortbow can deal the same damage as one arrow from a terminator bow. However terminator is much better because you're firing 3 arrows at once, making it really good for clearing as well as DPS.\n\nPlus you said to name one thing juju has over the hyperion. And it just so happens to be DPS. Plus it's much more cheaper than a hyperion", "How many creative minds do you have again? Its ridiculous that you think your opinion holds any ground against mine with an idea that the admins took and used all the time. I am an endgame player - if i sold ALL my skyblock cakes, ALL my pet collection (which is worth a lot even with candied pets) I can easily afford a tier boosted ender dragon and a giant's sword, which effectively makes me a lot farther along than most other end game players. I think the admins should just let me become a developer and give me another creative mind because that was also my idea and I should be reimbursed properly. If you guys think you're so good and better than me, try and get one yourself. Can you? I don't think so. The best you can do is just skillfully aoe one shot all the enemies you come across with your expensive gear. It shouldn't even be that expensive - look at recombs. Recombs should be less than 5 million coins even though they are 5 million coins to get from the chest. It sounds unreasonable but if your tiny pea dungeon player brains can even think properly, the mayor Paul reduces prices of dungeon loot by 20% so recombs shouldn't cost 5 million. If an item is too expensive for me to obtain, then its not fair to me as a content creator because it is now more difficult for me to gain and make 'content' out of it. However, once I get it due to inevitable price deflation its 'no longer worth it' and barely adds any content because I took too long to get the item myself and show it off. This is why Skyblock is dying - content creators like myself can't show off cool and new items because nothing is made in my own favor. And I already know what you guys are gonna say, \"oh he has a big ego\" or \"oh all he does is complain\" - I bet most people reading this message are just going to copy and paste it repeatedly to make fun of me but that's just going to reinforce my original point Im better than all of you, if you think you're better than me get some creative minds", "I've played Skyblock for 15k hours now, and now I have truly maxed out everything. For 2 years I have not talked to my parents, and forgot to feed my pet dog. Thankfully it seems to not complain, it's not moving at all actually. All my friends have left me, and my family disowned me. But now I am a true alpha male, and not some 3/4 sa non.\n\nI decide to go outside after finally completing Skyblock. I walk past my Marina Shrine and the mountain of drink cans that I have accumulated over 2 years. I step out of the dusty basement, walk out the front door, and is instantly struck by a blinding light. I'm starting to think that Dante was justified in removing the sun.\n\nI take off my filthy shirt and use it to cover my face. I see a 5 year old walking a dog, and think about how much combat exp it will give. When I see another kid selling lemonade on the street, I slap him in the face and tell him to stop scamming. And then, I see something that truly makes my blood boil. I see someone wearing a black hat, yellow shirt, black pants, and black shoes. The colors.... they remind me of all those nons I've met in the years of party finder.\n\nI charge at him, tackle him onto the ground, and beat his face into a bloody pulp. Then I spit on him and say \"Stop throwing the run you fucking non\" before I leave.\n\nNow, some of you may call me a \"psychopath\" or \"mentally deranged\", but the truth is, I am a true alpha male gamer, and you're just jealous because you are a soyboy beta cuck.", "photohaunt says i have a bad pb cuz his is 3:31, when he probably had a full team of super high cata players, probably had people haeling and probably skipped p4 or some shit\nive never said that high cata = skill, ive said the opposite multiple times, but if you play with like cata 46s who clear in like 70 seconds then no shit you're gonna get a better pb than me\nwhy do so many brainlets in dungeon gang just copy paste other peoples message and act like it's original and funny, clown", "Secrets should not be required for S+ dungeons runs in Hypixel SkyBlock. Rather, players should be rewarded for teamwork and defeating more difficult boss mobs with special attack patterns (ex Rev T5), not right clicking stupid boxes in the wall.
